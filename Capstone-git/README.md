# CAPSTONE PROJECT - Git

This is a project to demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Objectives

- Practice cloning a repository and working with branches in Git.

- Gain experience in staging, committing, and pushing changes from
both developers.

- Create pull requests and merge them after resolving any potential
conflicts.

### Setup

- I created a repository on GitHub, intialize it with a README file.
