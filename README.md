# This repository contains all projects done with Darey.io

## Darey.io projects are classified into two categories:
1. **Mini Projects**: These are small projects that are usually completed within a few hours. They are designed to help you practice and reinforce your understanding of the concepts learned in the course.

2. **Capstone Projects**: These are larger projects that require more time and effort to complete. They are designed to help you apply the concepts learned in the course to real-world scenarios.
## Mini Projects
<!-- ### Mini Project 1
This mini project is a simple Python script that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list. The script uses a for loop to iterate through the list and an if statement to check if each number is even. If the number is even, it is added to a running total, which is returned at the end of the script.

### Mini Project 2
This mini project is a simple Python script that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the odd numbers in the list. The script uses a for loop to iterate through the list and an if statement to check if each number is odd. If the number is odd, it is added to a running total, which is returned at the end of the script.

## Capstone Projects
<!-- ### Capstone Project 1
This capstone project is a simple Python script that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers in the list. The script uses a for loop to iterate through the list and adds each number to a running total, which is returned at the end of the script.

### Capstone Project 2
This capstone project is a simple Python script that takes a list of numbers and returns the average of the numbers in the list. The script uses a for loop to iterate through the list and adds each number to a running total, which is divided by the length of the list to get the average.
