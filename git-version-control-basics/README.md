# Git Version Control Basics

This project aims to illustrate the challenges of managing changes without version control.
Through the process of manually copying and maintaining versions of a simple text file, learners
will appreciate the complexity and inefficiency, emphasizing the importance of version control
in software development.

### Git Add and Git Commit Commands

After making changes to the repository, I added the file to the staging area by running git add and also took a snapshot of it by running git commit
<!-- 
```bash
git add <file-name>
``` -->
<!-- 
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
``` -->

## GitHub Repository URL

I created a repository with an index.html file at it's root:
